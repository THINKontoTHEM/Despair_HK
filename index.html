            This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.studioterp.nl/a-view-on-despair-a-datavisualization-project-by-studio-terp/"><b>A View on Despair</b></a>. where the author used calm and artistic visuals of landscapes to present data, offering a sense of solace and reflection. In Hong Kong, suicide is also a critical issue that deserves attention. In 2023, the estimated suicide rate was 13.6 per 100,000 people. While this hasn’t worsened significantly compared to the previous year, it remains relatively high.
            <br /><br />
            We’ve all been through a difficult few years with COVID-19, compounded by the stresses of international tensions and an economic downturn. Occasionally, we hear news of people who chose to end their lives, and it’s heartbreaking.
            <br /><br />
            From a personal perspective, the past few years have also been incredibly challenging. Growing up in a flourishing environment only to face an economic downturn during a critical transition into adulthood has been overwhelming. It’s a period naturally filled with uncertainty and self-doubt, and I know many of my peers may share similar feelings of struggle and suppression.
            <br /><br />
            While we are often taught to be self-reliant, seeking help from trusted friends or professionals during tough times can make a significant difference. Sometimes, the seemingly insurmountable problems in our lives might find alternative solutions when viewed from a different perspective.
            <br /><br />
            I hope the serene landscapes in this visualization can bring some comfort to your heart. This world is vast, and we are but tiny stars within it. Many things that trouble us may not be as significant as they seem. Take a moment to slow down. There is no hurdle in life that cannot be overcome.

        Females are more likely to choose jumping from height and drug consumption, reflecting emotionally driven and less violent tendencies.<br>

      <p class="section__text__p1"><b>The number of people who have died by suicide is alarming</b><BR><br>
        In 2019, approximately 650 males and 400 females ended their lives.. The persistent higher suicide rates among males compared to females suggest that societal pressures and lack of adequate support systems may disproportionately affect men.
        Overall, the total suicide count showed a slight decline from 2019 to 2021, dropping from around 1050 to 1000, followed by an increase back to approximately 1050 by 2024. This indicates that the underlying issues contributing to suicide remain largely unaddressed.

        <img src="./assets/by_method.png" alt="By Method">
        <p class="section__text__p1">Hanging is consistently the most prevalent method, particularly among males aged 20-30, with case counts reaching up to 20 in certain years. Jumping from height is the second most common method, with a noticeable spike in cases for both genders in the age group 40-50 around 2022, reaching as high as 15 cases. Poisoning shows a concerning increase among females aged 30-40, peaking at 10 cases in 2023. The data also highlights that individuals aged 20-30 and 30-40 experience higher suicide rates across multiple methods, underscoring the need for targeted mental health strategies.
          <br><br>Overall, the chart underscores the critical importance of comprehensive mental health support and timely intervention to address the ongoing suicide crisis in Hong Kong. Each data point represents a tragic loss, emphasizing the urgent need for collective action to prevent future suicides and support those in distress.
