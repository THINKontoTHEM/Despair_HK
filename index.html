            This project was inspired by <a href="https://www.studioterp.nl/a-view-on-despair-a-datavisualization-project-by-studio-terp/"><b>A View on Despair</b></a>. where the author used calm and artistic visuals of landscapes to present data, offering a sense of solace and reflection. In Hong Kong, suicide is also a critical issue that deserves attention. In 2023, the estimated suicide rate was 13.6 per 100,000 people. While this hasn’t worsened significantly compared to the previous year, it remains relatively high.
            <br /><br />
            We’ve all been through a difficult few years with COVID-19, compounded by the stresses of international tensions and an economic downturn. Occasionally, we hear news of people who chose to end their lives, and it’s heartbreaking.
            <br /><br />
            From a personal perspective, the past few years have also been incredibly challenging. Growing up in a flourishing environment only to face an economic downturn during a critical transition into adulthood has been overwhelming. It’s a period naturally filled with uncertainty and self-doubt, and I know many of my peers may share similar feelings of struggle and suppression.
            <br /><br />
            While we are often taught to be self-reliant, seeking help from trusted friends or professionals during tough times can make a significant difference. Sometimes, the seemingly insurmountable problems in our lives might find alternative solutions when viewed from a different perspective.
            <br /><br />
            I hope the serene landscapes in this visualization can bring some comfort to your heart. This world is vast, and we are but tiny stars within it. Many things that trouble us may not be as significant as they seem. Take a moment to slow down. There is no hurdle in life that cannot be overcome.

      <p class="section__text__p1"><b>In 2024, approximately 1,100 individuals chose to end their lives. The main reasons behind these tragic decisions were health issues (47.1%), financial difficulties (18.6%), and relationship problems (10.5%). The overall suicide rate was about 13.6 per 100,000 people. 
        <br><br>Notably, the suicide rate among those aged 70 and above was the highest across all age groups, while rates among individuals around 20 years old have also been rising. These findings highlight the urgent need to address the living conditions and mental health of Hong Kong's youth, chronically ill patients, and elderly population.

        <img src="./assets/by_method.png" alt="By Method">
        <p class="section__text__p1">Over the past five years, the most common methods of suicide were Jumping from Height, followed by Charcoal Burning / Self-Immolation and Hanging / Suffocation. Suicide rates in Hong Kong have shown an upward trend, exacerbated by the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic during the first three years of this period. Suicide is not just a personal issue but also a societal problem. It is crucial to engage more people in suicide prevention and intervention efforts.
          <br><br>
          In conclusion, the Hong Kong government must prioritize suicide prevention as a key public health agenda. A multi-faceted approach is essential, including enhancing education, raising awareness, improving social security systems, allocating more resources, and strengthening community support. Together, we can create a healthier and brighter environment for everyone in Hong Kong.
